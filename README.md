This repository holds the UTs for [cpp-common](https://github.com/Metaswitch/cpp-common).

It uses our common infrastructure to run the unit tests. How to run the UTs, and the different options available when running the UTs are described [here](http://clearwater.readthedocs.io/en/latest/Running_unit_tests.html#c-unit-tests).
